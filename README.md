4. Go to project folder in Windows terminal
5. Run: scala Project1.scala

This may require you to install Spark locally.

# Usage
When you run the program you will need to enter a number corresponding to the query you want to run. These queries will allow you to analyze and make decisions based on
the data given. This was created in hopes to aid in these decisions; leading to a more successful and profitable company.
